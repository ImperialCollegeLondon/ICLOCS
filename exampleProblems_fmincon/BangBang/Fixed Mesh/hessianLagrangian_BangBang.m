%  hessianLagrangian - Return the Hessian of the Lagrangian
%
% Syntax:  [HL,HE,Hf,Hg,Hb]=hessianLagrangian(X,U,P,t,E,x0,xf,u0,uf,p,tf,data)
%
% Inputs:
%    see directCollocation.m
%
% Outputs:
%    HL -  hessian of L wrt wz or a subset of its variables
%    HE -  hessian of E wrt [x0 xf u0 uf p t0 tf] or a subset of its variables
%    Hf -  hessian of f wrt  wz or a subset of its variables
%    Hg -  hessian of g wrt wz or a subset of its variables
%    Hb -  hessian of b wrt [x0 xf u0 uf p t0 tf]  or a subset of its variables
%
%   If the hessian of some component of the Lagrangian is not available set
%   the corresponding output term equal to the empty matrix. 
%   For instance if the hessian of the dynamical system is not available set Hf=[]; 
%   If  some variables do not contribute to the Hessian, the corresponding entries  can be set  to zero, otherwise the entries 
%   have to be vectors with the same length of t, containing the value of the Hessian at different  time instants.
%
% The vector wz is defined as wz=[x, u, p, t]. The variables
% have the following meaning:
%
%    t - denotes the time variable. The hessian with respect to the time t must be considered only if 
%        the final time tf is a decision variable of the optimal control problem 
%    p - parameters.  The hessian with respect to the  p has to be
%        considered only if the optimal control problem depends on some
%        constant parameter that is an optimization variable
%    x - denotes the state variable x=[x1, x2,   xn] where n is the
%        dimension of the state equation.
%    u - denotes the input variable u=[u1, u2,   um] where m is the number
%        of the control inputs
%   
%    Each hessian has to be specified in a cell array of dimension depending on the variables in wz 
%    or in [x0 xf u0 uf p t0 pf] considering the following rules. 
%    The order to follow is  given by the order of the vector variables inside wz=[t p x u] or [x0 xf u0 uf p t0 pf]. 
%    
%    Hessian wrt wz or a subset of its variables: 
%    If tf (or/and p) is not a decision variable the derivative with respect to time (or/and p) must 
%    not be considered i.e the Hessian must be computed wrt [x u p] or ([x u t] or [x u]) 
%    
%    Hessian wrt [x0 xf u0 uf p t0 pf] or a subset of its variables: 
%    The Hessian with respect to the variables tf, p, x0, u0, uf and xf has to be considered on the basis of the 
%    specified analytic gradient when its evaluation is enabled (flag=1).
%    For instance if db.flag=1 and db.dtf, db.dp,  db.du0 and db.duf are  empty matrices and  db.dx0 and db.dxf are specified
%    (see  the file  jacConst.m) the Hessian must be specified considering the vector of decision variables [x0 xf].
%    Moreover if tf (or/and p) is not a decision variable (nt=0 (or/and np=0)) the derivative with respect to  
%    the final time (or/and p) must not be considered 
%    If  flag=0 the Hessian with respect to the variables x0, u0, uf and xf  must be always specified
